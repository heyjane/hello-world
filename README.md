# Hello, World!
This project was added as an introduction to HTML and CSS for the Udacity FEND program.
Although this project was not required for my cohort, it is a very simple project, so 
I completed it.  Basically, I created an HTML file that writes "Hello, World!" on the 
screen with a CSS file that styles the text.  Then I edited the CSS file to change
the text to red.

Source files:

HTML: <a href="https://github.com/heyjane/hello-world/blob/master/index.html">https://github.com/heyjane/hello-world/blob/master/index.html</a>

CSS: <a href="https://github.com/heyjane/hello-world/blob/master/css/style.css">https://github.com/heyjane/hello-world/blob/master/css/style.css</a>
